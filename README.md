OPENSNAP
==========

What's that?
------------
Opensnap brings the Aero Snap feature to Openbox.


Does this work with other window managers?
------------------------------------------
The goal was to make it work with every EWMH compliant window manager.


Dependencies?
-------------
You'll need wmctrl.

On most debian systems you should be able to install it by:

sudo apt-get install wmctrl


How can I use it?
-------------------
This should tell you all you need to know:

opensnap -h

Copy the sample configs to ~/.config/opensnap/ (and edit them if needed).

They are mostly self explaining.
